<h1> CIFAR-10 Keras Tuner Model</h1> 
<p> This project demonstrates how to use the Keras Tuner library to search for the best hyperparameters for a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 
image classification dataset. The goal is to build a CNN model that can accurately classify images into one of ten categories, including airplanes, cars, birds, 
cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each with a resolution of 32x32 pixels and 3 color channels. We preprocess the data by scaling the pixel values to be between 0 and 1 and one-hot encoding the class labels.

We then use the Keras Tuner library to search for the best hyperparameters for the CNN model. Specifically, we search for the optimal number of convolutional layers, the number of filters in each convolutional layer, the dropout rate, and the number of units in the dense layer. We use a RandomSearch algorithm to search the hyperparameter space, and evaluate each candidate model using the validation accuracy metric.

Once the search is complete, we retrieve the best model(s) and evaluate its performance on the test set. We also show an example of how to use the trained model to predict the label of a test image and display the image along with its predicted label.

The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook using Python 3, Keras, TensorFlow, and Keras Tuner. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it a great starting point for exploring hyperparameter tuning for CNNs on image classification tasks.

This project could be further extended by using other tuning algorithms, exploring different architectures or optimization algorithms, or applying transfer learning techniques to improve the accuracy of the model. It can be a great addition to an AI Engineer's portfolio, showcasing their ability to work with CNNs, hyperparameter tuning, and image classification tasks.</p>
