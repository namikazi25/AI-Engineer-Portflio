Here we implemented 5 Different Models (SVM, XGBoost, Decision Tree Classifer, Extra Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifer and compared the result. </li>

<!-- Here are the codes we did for Demystifying Black box Learning Models of Rumor Detection from Social Media Posts
There is two types of dataset used one in for general social media posts and another one is Covid-19 related Social Media Posts. We used five Machine Learning Models ( SVC, XGBoost, Random Forest, Extra Random Tree Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier) separately and also created a hybrid ensemble model consisting to all five models five times and two Deep Learning Models (LSTM and Bert) to predict rumor and non-rumor labels from that posts in the datasets. -->
